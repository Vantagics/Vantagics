# VantageData

A commercially qualified Smart Business Intelligence Suite.

## Initial Concept
VantageData is a Wails-based desktop application designed to empower non-technical users with intuitive data insights. It bridges the gap between complex data and actionable intelligence through a user-friendly interface.

## Target Audience
The primary focus is on **non-technical users** who need to understand their data without needing specialized technical or analytical skills. This includes managers, small business owners, and departmental leads who require quick, clear answers from their business data.

## Core Goals & Value Proposition
- **Data Simplification:** Transform complex data into intuitive visualizations and natural language summaries that are easy to understand at a glance.
- **Automated Insights:** Proactively identify trends, patterns, and anomalies using automated generation, reducing the need for manual data exploration.
- **Frictionless Connectivity:** Provide a "plug-and-play" experience for connecting to common data sources, ensuring users can start getting value immediately.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Customizable, drag-and-drop dashboards that allow users to arrange and view their most important metrics in one place.
- **Smart Reports:** Automated reports that stay up-to-date with the latest data and can be easily exported to standard formats like PDF and Excel.
- **Persistent AI Assistant:** A multi-thread chat interface that remembers conversation history, allowing users to build complex analyses over time.
- **Broad Model Support:** Connect to industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic, or utilize local/open-source models via OpenAI-compatible or Claude-compatible endpoints for enhanced privacy and cost-efficiency.
- **Custom Run Environments:** Select and validate Python environments (System, Conda, Virtualenv) to safely execute generated analysis scripts with required dependencies like Pandas and Matplotlib.
